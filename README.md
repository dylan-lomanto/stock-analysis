# Stock Analysis

### Overview

The client, Steve, has requested a refactored version of the originally presented code, that is efficient enough to analyze the entire stock market in a reasonable amount of time.  The original code examines tables for 2017 and 2018 for 12 green stocks that displays daily trade counts and a variety of daily pricing categories. For our purposes the relevant fields are ticker, closing price, and volume. The original code outputs a table for either year with the ticker, total daily volume, and annual return percentage.  The total daily volume is acquired by summing the daily volumes for each ticker. The return percentage is calculated by dividing the final daily closing value by the first daily closing value for each ticker.
